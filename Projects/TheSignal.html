						<h3>What is The Signal?</h3>
						<p>The Signal is a sci-fi open world survival craft game that I worked on as a Junior Gameplay Programmer and as a UI programmer at Goosebyte Studios.	
							
							<br><br> The game is set on an alien planet where the player must scavenge for resources, build shelter, and fend off hostile creatures while uncovering the mystery behind a strange signal that beckoned them to come to their planet to find their lost relative.						
							<br><br> The project was announced to the public in mid-2023 via IGN and has frequent playtests and updates.
							<br><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-signal-an-unreal-engine-5-powered-multiplayer-survivalcrafting-game-announced">Link to the IGN article</a>
							<br><br> Since then, the game has changed drastically, even including a rename to The Signal: Stranded On Sirenis and a complete art overhaul.

								<h3>My contributions to the project</h3>
								<p>During my time working on The Signal, I was responsible for implementing various gameplay mechanics and systems, including but not limited to:
									<ul>
										<li>Player movement and controls</li>
										<li>Inventory management system</li>
										<li>Crafting system</li>
										<li>UI elements such as health bars, inventory screens, and crafting menus</li>
										</ul>
									
									Given that we were a small team I was involved in many parts of the development of the game. I covered gameplay, UI, UX and managed a small team for the UI.
									<br><br> Working on The Signal was a great learning experience for me as it allowed me to apply my programming skills in a real-world setting and collaborate with other developers, artists, and designers to bring the game to life.

								<h3>My Aspirations</h3>
								<p>While I don't think I'll be the next Notch or anything, I am aiming to hone my skills as well as possible to become as good of a developer that I can and I hope to one day be able to proudly say that I'm either part of or have developed something with great meaning to a lot of people.
									<br><br> I simply want to be able to have a positive impact on the world through my work, no matter how big or small that impact may be.
